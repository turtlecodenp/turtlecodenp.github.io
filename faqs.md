                    We understand that students already have lot of classes going on. So we give the student choice to choose the timetable. Students shall be requested to provide any two different times in a week when they can attend the sessions. After confirmations every week these timings will only be used which makes it easier for students to attend classes without any hassle. 
                    <br>NOTE: Given some situations classes can be shifted if required.

                    Classes are scheduled keeping in mind the availability of students only. If by chance student misses the class we will keep the compensation class to cover the portion missed. We take full responsibility of teaching students of topics that we have promissed.
