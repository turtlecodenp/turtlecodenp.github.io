<p class="go-home">
	TurtleCode is on a path to make innovators for the future of Nepal. Coding is regarded as one of the most essential skill in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education. We believe on planting and nurturing the seed of coding in early ages helps children to learn fast with increased cognitive ability. Although school curriculum do include "Computer Science" as one of the courses but they are not taught on how to write computer software. We provide a fun and interactive environment for your child to maximize their creativity and logical thinking. If your child is smart enough to play games you don't understand, they sure are smart enough to build one too.

<h2 class="go-home">What Do We Do</h2>
<p class="go-home">
  We are bunch of young minds who are aware of global happenings in the field of programming and how it has been efficiently been channelized to kids all around the world. Lack of awareness on programming led us to take us an initiative for making available a platform for students and kids so that they can too learn about programming and its wonders.
